  %h3 How to use this form:

  %ul
    %li
      %p
        It is recommended that you have Javascript enabled and, if
        using Internet Explorer, upgrade to version 8 or newer
    %li
      %p
        %span{ :style => "color: red;" } Red text
        indicates required information that has not yet been
        provided or input that does not look valid.
    %li
      %p
        Information you provide is not sent to the web server until
        you press either
        %em 'Apply Changes'
        or
        %em 'Save and Exit'
        near the bottom of this page. This also applies to files
        selected for uploading. Once the data is sent, you can log out
        or leave this page and continue editing at a later time.
    %li
      %p
        Please note however that once you have submitted a study, you
        will no longer be able to edit it.
    %li
      %p
        Some fields in this form are repeatable. With Javascript
        enabled, additional lines should automatically appear as
        needed. Alternatively, you can press
        %em 'Apply Changes'
        to see the extra lines.
    %li
      %p
        Some fields offer lists of pre-defined answers via
        drop-down boxes. You can modify these once selected (for
        example to indicate which part of a study the answer applies
        to) or, if none fits, use your own words.
    %li
      %p
        Dates can be specified as a year, year and month, or full
        date. Providing a four-digit year and three-letter month
        as in 'Jan 2010' helps avoid ambiguities, but other
        formats are also accepted.
    %li
      %p
        To delete a study, visit
        %em 'View Deposits'
        via the menu bar on the left.
