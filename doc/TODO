Bugs:
----
- Some drop-down boxes do not appear or don't close (IE8)
- Some resizable text area boxes are bad at gaining focus on clicks (IE8)
- abstract gets truncated in study summary

Quick tweaks:
------------
- generate a file contents.txt (see study 01190 for format)
- preserve paragraph breaks in abstract in DDI for Nesstar Publisher
- allow affiliations to be left out (or advise to type 'n.a.'?)
- in attachment tab, say what kind of documentation is needed
- instruct depositors to describe parts if study has multiple
- use Windows-style line-endings in files to be read by humans (?)

More substantial, but somewhat urgent:
-------------------------------------
- provide automatic virus scanning
- implement some kind up quota policy for uploading files

Other improvements:
------------------
- allow admins to add or remove archivists (also admins?)
- allow depositors to describe files they will submit by other means
- allow depositors to use an existing study as template (?)
- context help ('question mark' links or suchlike)
- more detailed categories for attached files: Questionaire, Report, Notes
- copy attached files to processing folder with standard naming
- fill in "Related Materials" with info on attached files (?)
- add a tagging system to support studies with multiple parts
