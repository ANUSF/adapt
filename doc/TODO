Quick tweaks:
------------
- do not show paths for files selected for upload (Windows 'fakepath' issue)
- use Windows-compliant line-endings in files intended to be read by humans
- instruct depositors to describe parts if study has multiple
- add info on what kind of documentation should be provided with studies

More substantial, but somewhat urgent:
-------------------------------------
- provide automatic virus scanning
- implement some kind up quota policy for uploading files

Other improvements:
------------------
- allow admins to add or remove archivists (also admins?)
- allow depositors to describe files they will submit by other means
- allow depositors to use an existing study as template (?)
- context help ('question mark' links or suchlike)
- more detailed categories for attached files: Questionaire, Report, Notes
- copy attached files to processing folder with standard naming
- fill in "Related Materials" with info on attached files (?)
- add a tagging system to support studies with multiple parts
