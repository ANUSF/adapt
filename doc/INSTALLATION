== Installing a development copy of ADAPT: ==

''(These instructions presume you are working on a Unix/Linux OS and install jruby locally. For other environments the commands to be executed may vary slightly.)''

0.  Install a sufficiently recent JDK.

1.  Install jruby from http://jruby.org

2.  Install Rails and some additional Ruby packages:

    jruby -S gem install rails activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter jruby-openssl

3.  Install git (from the appropriate package under Linux, or from http://git-scm.com).

4.  Get the adapt code from the git repository (IMPORTANT: don't keep the source code in a folder called 'adapt' in your home directory):

    git clone ssh://<user>@dc2//projects/u47/usr/oxd900/git/adapt adapt-source

5.  Move into the adapt source directory thus created:

    cd adapt-source

6.  Install extra packages required by adapt:

    jruby -S rake gems:install

    (If this fails, try 'jruby -S gem install haml' and then repeat the command above.)

7.  Start the web server:

    ./script/server

8.  To see if everything worked, direct your web browser to the URL http://localhost:3000.

==== Further steps to create war files: ====

9.  Install warbler:

    jruby -S gem install warbler

10. Create the CSS files:

    jruby -S sass -q -C --update public/stylesheets/sass:public/stylesheets

11. Run it:

    jruby -S warble

You should now have a file named 'adapt.war'.

==== Re-building when source code has changed: ====

12. Update your source code:

    git pull

13. Repeat steps 10 and 11 in that order.
