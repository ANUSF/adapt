== Installing a development copy of ADAPT: ==

''(These instructions presume you are working on a Unix/Linux OS and
install jruby locally. For other environments, the commands to be
executed may vary slightly. There is also a more recent version of
ADAPT using Rails3 which currently cannot be deployed as a war
file.)''

0.  Install a sufficiently recent JDK.

1.  Install jruby from http://jruby.org

2.  Install Rails and some additional Ruby packages:

      jruby -S gem install rails --version=2.3.10
      jruby -S gem install activerecord-jdbcsqlite3-adapter

3.  Install git (from the appropriate package under Linux, or from
    http://git-scm.com).

4.  Get the adapt code from the git repository (IMPORTANT: don't keep
    the source code in a folder called 'adapt' in your home directory):

      git clone git@github.com:ANUSF/adapt.git adapt-source

5.  Move into the adapt source directory thus created:

      cd adapt-source

6.  Install extra packages required by adapt:

      jruby -S rake gems:install

6a. (FIXME!) Some extra in-house gems are needed from github.

7.  Start the web server:

      ./script/server

8.  To see if everything worked, direct your web browser to the URL
    http://localhost:3000.

==== Further steps to create war files: ====

9.  Create the CSS files:

      jruby -S sass -q -C --update public/stylesheets/sass:public/stylesheets

10. Install warbler:

      jruby -S gem install warbler

11. Run it:

      jruby -S warble

You should now have a file named 'adapt-<xxxx>.war', where <xxxx> is a
14-digit timestamp.

==== Re-building when source code has changed: ====

12. Update your source code:

      git pull

13. Repeat steps 9 and 11 in that order.
